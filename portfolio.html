            <h4>About Me</h4>
               <p> Professionally i am a mechanical engineer.i studied mechanical and a bit of electrical 
                   that was in relation to my field.In engineering there is a meshing of fields known as 
                   mechatronics which marries mechanical,electrical and computer science.You see most machines
                   need electricity and electronic circuits.These days all systems are going smart that is 
                   they need computer science.for example robots,elevators,digitally controlled combustion 
                   engines,electronic cars.<strong>Everything!</strong>.Basically machines need software.This 
                   is why i decided to take this program.
